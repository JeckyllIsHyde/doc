@article{Verdaasdonk2009,
abstract = {Like human walking, passive dynamic walking-i.e. walking down a slope with no actuation except gravity-is energy efficient by exploiting the natural dynamics. In the animal world, neural oscillators termed central pattern generators (CPGs) provide the basic rhythm for muscular activity in locomotion. We present a CPG model, which automatically tunes into the resonance frequency of the passive dynamics of a bipedal walker, i.e. the CPG model exhibits resonance tuning behavior. Each leg is coupled to its own CPG, controlling the hip moment of force. Resonance tuning above the endogenous frequency of the CPG-i.e. the CPG's eigenfrequency-is achieved by feedback of both limb angles to their corresponding CPG, while integration of the limb angles provides resonance tuning at and below the endogenous frequency of the CPG. Feedback of the angular velocity of both limbs to their corresponding CPG compensates for the time delay in the loop coupling each limb to its CPG. The resonance tuning behavior of the CPG model allows the gait velocity to be controlled by a single parameter, while retaining the energy efficiency of passive dynamic walking.},

@article{Kuo2010,
abstract = {A healthy gait pattern depends on an array of biomechanical features, orchestrated by the central nervous system for economy and stability. Injuries and other pathologies can alter these features and result in substantial gait deficits, often with detrimental consequences for energy expenditure and balance. An understanding of the role of biomechanics in the generation of healthy gait, therefore, can provide insight into these deficits. This article examines the basic principles of gait from the standpoint of dynamic walking, an approach that combines an inverted pendulum model of the stance leg with a pendulum model of the swing leg and its impact with the ground. The heel-strike at the end of each step has dynamic effects that can contribute to a periodic gait and its passive stability. Biomechanics, therefore, can account for much of the gait pattern, with additional motor inputs that are important for improving economy and stability. The dynamic walking approach can predict the consequences of disruptions to normal biomechanics, and the associated observations can help explain some aspects of impaired gait. This article reviews the basic principles of dynamic walking and the associated experimental evidence for healthy gait and then considers how the principles may be applied to clinical gait pathologies.},

Among the inves- tigated intelligent approaches for solving locomotion problems are oscillator based Central Pattern Genera- tors, Neural Networks, Hidden Markov models, Rule Based and Fuzzy Logic systems, as well as Analytical concepts. We try to compare those methods based on the quality of the produced solutions in terms of time, stability, correctness and the expense and cost for achieving them. At the end of each section we list the advantages and disadvantages of the reviewed meth- ods and scrutinize themconsidering the complexity of the approaches, their applicability to the investigated locomotion tasks and the constraints of the produced solutions. The reviewed publications examine a range of legged and non-legged systems, operating in sim- ple and complex environments, with several different locomotion tasks.},

abstract = {The fields of control and robotics are working toward the development of bipedal robots that can realize walking motions with the stability and agility of a human being. Dynamic models for bipeds are hybrid in nature. They contain both continuous and discrete elements, with switching events that are governed by a combination of unilateral constraints and impulse-like forces that occur at foot touchdown. Control laws for these machines must be hybrid as well. The goals of this paper are fourfold: highlight certain properties of the models which greatly influence the control law design; overview the literature; present two control design approaches in depth; and indicate some of the many open problems.},

The passive dynamic walking has distinguished advantages compared with other methodologies in robotics, mainly because that the passive dynamic robotics focuses on and exploits the dynamics of the mechanisms of the biped robot. In addition, the development of passive dynamic walkers is introduced. Control strategies are necessary to improve the stability and robustness of locomotion of passive dynamic walkers, such as the slope invariant control, the energy based control and the learning control, are discussed briefly. Finally, the unresolved problems in the field of the passive dynamic walking are summarized, and directions of further developments are discussed.},

abstract = {The basic mechanics of human locomotion are associated with vaulting over stiff legs in walking and rebounding on compliant legs in running. However, while rebounding legs well explain the stance dynamics of running, stiff legs cannot reproduce that of walking. With a simple bipedal spring-mass model, we show that not stiff but compliant legs are essential to obtain the basic walking mechanics; incorporating the double support as an essential part of the walking motion, the model reproduces the characteristic stance dynamics that result in the observed small vertical oscillation of the body and the observed out-of-phase changes in forward kinetic and gravitational potential energies. Exploring the parameter space of this model, we further show that it not only combines the basic dynamics of walking and running in one mechanical system, but also reveals these gaits to be just two out of the many solutions to legged locomotion offered by compliant leg behaviour and accessed by energy or speed.},

abstract = {Compared with wheeled mobile robots, legged robots can easily step over obstacles and walk through rugged ground. They have more flexible bodies and therefore, can deal with complex environment. Nev- ertheless, some other issues make the locomotion control of legged robots a much complicated task, such as the redundant degree of freedoms and balance keeping. From literatures, locomotion control has been solved mainly based on programming mechanism. To use this method, walking trajectories for each leg and the gaits have to be designed, and the adaptability to an unknown environment cannot be guaranteed. From another aspect, studying and simulating animals’ walking mechanism for engi- neering application is an efficient way to break the bottleneck of locomotion control for legged robots. This has attracted more and more attentions. Inspired by central pattern generator (CPG), a control method has been proved to be a successful attempt within this scope. In this paper, we will review the biological mechanism, the existence evidences, and the network properties of CPG. From the en- gineering perspective, we will introduce the engineering simulation of CPG, the property analysis, and the research progress of CPG inspired control method in locomotion control of legged robots. Then, in our research, we will further discuss on existing problems, hot issues, and future research directions in this field},

@article{Huang2014,
abstract = {Walking behavior is modulated by controlling joint torques in most existing passivity-based bipeds. Controlled Passive Walking with adaptable stiffness exhibits controllable natural motions and energy efficient gaits. In this paper, we propose torque-stiffness-controlled dynamic bipedal walking, which extends the concept of Controlled Passive Walking by introducing structured control parameters and a bio-inspired control method with central pattern generators. The proposed walking paradigm is beneficial in clarifying the respective effects of the external actuation and the internal natural dynamics. We present a seven-link biped model to validate the presented walking. Effects of joint torque and joint stiffness on gait selection, walking performance and walking pattern transitions are studied in simulations. The work in this paper develops a new solution of motion control of bipedal robots with adaptable stiffness and provides insights of efficient and sophisticated walking gaits of humans.},

abstract = {A review of human walking modeling and simulation is presented. This review focuses on physics-based human walking simulations in the robotics and biomechanics literature. The gait synthesis methods are broadly divided into five categories: (1) inverted pendulum model; (2) passive dynamics walking; (3) zero moment point (ZMP) methods; (4) optimization-based methods; and (5) control-based methods. Features of various methods are discussed, and their advantages and disadvantages are delineated. The modeling, formulation, and computation aspects of each method are reviewed.},
